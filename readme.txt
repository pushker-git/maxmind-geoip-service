# Read database/readme.txt file to setup offline maxmind database - currently it is using GeoLite2 database

### difference between GeoLite2 vs GeoIP2 database
GeoLite2 databases are free IP geolocation databases comparable to, but less accurate than, MaxMindâ€™s GeoIP2 databases. The GeoLite2 Country, City, and ASN databases are updated weekly, every Tuesday. GeoLite2 data is also available as a web service in the GeoLite2 Country and GeoLite2 City web services. Users of the GeoLite2 web services are limited to 1000 IP address lookups per service per day.

## API 

GET API /geoip/v1/city/{ip_address}

TODO - AUTO UPDATE the database on regular interval
